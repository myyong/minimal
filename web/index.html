        <h1>NIPS 2016 Workshop</h1>
        <h2>Artificial Intelligence for Data Science</h2>

        <p>Machine learning methods have been applied beyond their origins in artificial intelligence to a wide variety of data analysis problems in fields such as science, health care, technology, and commerce. Previous research in machine learning, perhaps motivated by its roots in AI, has primarily aimed at fully-automated approaches for prediction problems. But predictive analytics is only one step in the larger pipeline of data science, which includes data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory visualization, data integration, model criticism and revision, and presentation of results to domain experts. </p>

		<p>An emerging strand of work aims to address all of these challenges in one stroke is by automating a greater portion of the full data science pipeline. This workshop will bring together experts in machine learning, data mining, databases and statistics to discuss the challenges that arise in the full end-to-end process of collecting data, analysing data, and making decisions and building new methods that support, whether in an automated or semi-automated way, more of the full process of analysing real data.</p>

		<p>Considering the full process of data science raises interesting questions for discussion, such as: What aspects of data analysis might potentially be automated and what aspects seem more difficult? Statistical model building often emphasizes interpretability and human understanding, while machine learning often emphasizes predictive modeling --- are ML methods truly suitable for supporting the full data analysis pipeline? Do recent advances in ML offer help here? Finally, are there low hanging fruit, i.e., how much time is wasted on routine tasks in scientific data analysis that could be automated? </p>
